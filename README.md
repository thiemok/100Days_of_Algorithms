### 100 days of algorithms

This repository contains code to implement the [100 days of algorithms](https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms) challenge.

I set the challenge for myself to implement algorithm by algorithm, day by day, until the number reaches **100**.

If you are interested, here's the [intro to the series](https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms/100-days-of-algorithms-challenge-41996f7e1ec8) and [all the articles](https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms/latest) sorted by date from the latest.

I will also use this challenge to get started with golang and its ecosystem.
So:
- Do not expect the implementations to be the best, nor fastest, nor nicest, nor bug-free.
- Do expect to see code written in haste.
- Expect code that contains the same amount of enthusiasm and love to algorithms as many it contains bugs.

Feel free to (re)use my code in any way you wish, but bare in mind that the source code is provided "as-is". It is on your own risk and you are solely responsible for whatever happens then.
