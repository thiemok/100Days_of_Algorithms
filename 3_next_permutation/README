### Day 3: Next permutation
Given a [totally ordered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order) set,
find the next [permutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#Permutations_of_totally_ordered_sets)
of the current configuration: `FADE -> FAED -> FDAE -> FDEA -> ..`
Even though almost every library offers a similar function,
this tool can quickly become very useful in various competitions when you need to speed your algorithm up.

#### Algorithm
The algorithm itself is simple.

1. Beginning from end, find the longest decreasing sequence 42**531**
2. Denote the preceding item as pivot 4**2**531
3. Swap pivot with the smallest higher item in the sequence 4**3**5**2**1
4. Revert the sequence 43**125**.
